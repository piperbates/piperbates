# Hi, I'm Piper

I'm a fullstack software developer with a background in illustration. I adore learning, and moved into tech in 2020 after realising that this is the industry that really lets you never stop learning! 

I've spent the last 5 years working as a freelance illustrator, and when Covid19 lockdown hit, it helped me take a big step back and look at my career, what I liked about it and what I didn't. I decided I needed a new challenge, doing something that solves real world problems in a creative and evolving field. I was chosen out of almost 2,000 applicants to be on cohort 4 of the School of Code bootcamp, a 16 week intensive course that taught JavaScript, React, Node.Js, express.js, and more. 

I'm now continuing my learning outside of the School of Code, having started the #100DaysOfCode challenge to keep growing and developing my skills as a developer while I search for my first job as a junior developer.

# :sparkles: Welcome to my GitHub, I'm Piper :sparkles:

I'm a Software Engineer, and have a background in illustration. I adore learning, and during 2020 Covid lockdown I studied at School of Code to change my career into tech and haven't looked back. I'm passionate about accessibility and diversity, and this has been the hallmark of my career so far - I strongly believe that a good application === an accessible application, and have championed that in all of my roles. I'm also a big believer in the power of mentoring, and am a mentor of the School of Code bootcamp where I support new developers through their career changing journey. 

I'm currently working as a front end engineer, and have a strong interest in UI / UX design although have had previous experience full stack and would be interested in moving back into more full stack roles for the right company.

PS: If you're checking this out because you're interested in recruiting me, hi! Oh, on a __completely__ unrelated note, I make really killer cookies. Just wanted to make people aware of that important fact for no reason.
